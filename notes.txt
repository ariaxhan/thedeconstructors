"/:city" : Selecting an option from a potential dropdown menu from home page brings you to the sub url. Ex: "/san-francisco"
"/:city/:entity" : Renders table containing info of murder dependent on user info to a sub url from "/:city". Ex: "/san-francisco/murder-weapon" or "/oakland/race" or "/los-angeles/motive"
